-- 3. 10. 2018

* The project was re-structured from src/ structure to lib/ and include/
  structure. As a consequence, all public headers were moved to dg/
  subdirectory, e.g. "llvm/LLVMDependenceGraph.h" is now
  "dg/llvm/LLVMDependenceGraph.h"

* Renamed files:
- llvm/Slicer.h -> dg/llvm/LLVMSlicer.h
- llvm/analysis/PointsTo/PointsTo.h -> dg/llvm/analysis/PointsTo/PointerAnalysis.h
- analysis/PointsTo/PointsToFlowSensitive.h -> dg/analysis/PointsTo/PointerAnalysisFS.h
- analysis/PointsTo/PointsToFlowInsensitive.h -> dg/analysis/PointsTo/PointerAnalysisFI.h
- analysis/PointsTo/PointsToWithInvalidate.h -> dg/analysis/PointsTo/PointerAnalysisFSInv.h

* A new library libDGAnalysis.so was added. You must link to this library
  when linking with any dg library.
