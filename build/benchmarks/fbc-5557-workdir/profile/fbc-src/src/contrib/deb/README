Run makedeb.sh to create a .deb package from the stuff in this FreeBASIC tree.
The output .deb file name can be passed on the command line. If ommitted, it
will use the default name "package.deb".

The "control" file will be used as the DEBIAN/control file for the package.
The string "<installedsize>" in the control file will automatically be
replaced by the size returned by "du".

Usage example:
    ./makedeb.sh freebasic_0.22.0_i386.deb
