Command-line Repository Root Relative URL Support
=================================================

Syntax Description 
------------------

"^/[REL-URL][@PEG]"

'^/':      Represents the root url of the repository
'REL_URL': Desired path relative to the root of the repository
'@PEG':    Optional standard peg revision

Examples:

	^/
	^/trunk
	^/branches/1.5.x@25000
	^/tags/1.4.6/@{2007-12-20T14:37:37.868870Z}

Repository Root URL Determination Logic
---------------------------------------

- If there are arguments that are not root relative urls
  - Find the repository root url of each of the non root relative urls
    - If their repository root urls do not match, issue an error
    - Else use the matching repository root url in place of '^/' in all
      the root relative urls
- ElseIf the current working directory is a Subversion working copy
  - Determine the repository root url for the current working copy
    - If successful, use that repository root url in place of '^/' in all 
      the root relative urls
    - Else issue an error
- Else issue an error

Special Considerations
----------------------

The repository root relative syntax is '^/', not '^'.  So use '^/' to refer to
the root of the repository.  URLs that begin with a '^' are reserved for future
extension.

Shells That Treat '^' Specially
-------------------------------

ISSUE:      zsh with 'setopt extendedglob' enabled
WORKAROUND: quote it in single quotes:  '^/'
WORKAROUND: escape it with a backslash: \^/

ISSUE:      cmd.exe
WORKAROUND: Double it: ^^/
