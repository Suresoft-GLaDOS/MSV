.SH NAME
@PACKAGE@_get_tunnel_user_name \- get the username of the current user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <@PACKAGE@/get_tunnel_user_name.h>

.BI "int @PACKAGE@_get_tunnel_user_name(char* " buf ,
.br
.BI "                                 size_t " bufsize ");"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fetches the username that should be passed to
.BR svnserve (8)
via the
.B \-\-tunnel\-user
argument.

This function uses the
.BR getlogin_r (3)
function to fetch the username of the user that invoked this
process.  If
.B getlogin_r
is unavailable or returns an error,
.BR getpwuid_r (3)
is used instead.  Note that if multiple users share the same user ID,
this function may return the wrong username.

This function is thread-safe if the user's C POSIX library is
thread-safe.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I buf
Pointer to a buffer of length
.I bufsize
where the null-terminated username will be written.  This may be the
null pointer if
.I bufsize
is 0.  This function will not write beyond the end of the buffer
.RI ( buf " + " bufsize
\- 1).
.TP
.I bufsize
Size of the buffer at
.IR buf .
If 0,
.I buf
will not be written to and may be the null pointer.  If the buffer
size is less than the length of the null-terminated login name, then
.I buf
will be filled with a truncated, null-terminated version of the login
name.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, returns the length of the username (not including the null
terminator) to use with the
.B \-\-tunnel\-user
argument to
.BR svnserve .
Thus, if the return value is less than
.IR bufsize ,
the buffer at
.I buf
contains the full username.  If the return value is greater than or
equal to
.IR bufsize ,
the username was truncated to fit in
.IR buf .

On error, a negative value is returned and
.I errno
(see
.BR errno (3))
is set.
.SH ERRORS
Error conditions and
.I errno
(see
.BR errno (3))
values are described in the specifications for
.BR getpwuid_r "(3) and " snprintf "(3), "
with the addition that
.B EINVAL
may indicate that no username is associated with the UID of the
invoking user.
.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
This function uses
.BR getlogin_r (3)
to determine the login name.  Since users might be able to trick
.B getlogin_r
into returning an arbitrary username on some systems, the results are
verified using
.BR getpwnam_r (3).
This verification does not prevent a user from imitating another user
if the two users share the same user ID.  If verification fails, or if
.B getlogin_r
fails for any reason,
.BR getpwuid_r (3)
is used instead.

This function may return the incorrect username if multiple users
share the same user ID.
