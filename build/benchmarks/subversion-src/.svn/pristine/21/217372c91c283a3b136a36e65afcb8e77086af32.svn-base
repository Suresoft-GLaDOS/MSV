API ERRATA -- $Id$

Root Cause of Errata: implementation/docstring mismatch
 Library(s) Affected: libsvn_fs_fs, libsvn_fs_base, libsvn_repos
Function(s) Affected: svn_fs_commit_txn, svn_repos_fs_commit_txn
     New Behavior in: n/a
      Related Issues: n/a


== Details ==

The docstring for svn_fs_commit_txn() stated that the returned
CONFLICT_PATH value was allocated in the transaction's pool. However,
the two implementations (BDB and FSFS) allocate the path in the POOL
parameter passed to the function.

This behavior is directly propagated to the svn_repos_fs_commit_txn
function and its CONFLICT_PATH and POOL parameters.

For the 1.8 release, the docstring has been updated to match the
implementation: the path is allocated in the provided pool.


== Impact on API Users ==

If an API user expected the path to live in the transaction pool, then
it may run into problems depending upon the lifetime of the provided
pool, relative to the transaction pool. A number of callers abort the
transaction when such a conflict occurs; if the implementation had
actually placed the path into the transaction pool, it would become
invalid when the transaction is aborted and likely cause problems for
any caller truly expecting the path to live in the transaction pool.

All API users should review their use of the CONFLICT_PATH parameter
and the necessary lifetime.
