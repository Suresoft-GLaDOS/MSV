API ERRATA -- $Id$

Root Cause of Errata: 
 Library(s) Affected: libsvn_ra, RA servers (svnserve, mod_dav_svn)
Function(s) Affected: svn_delta_editor_t
     New Behavior in: 1.8 (default), 1.4 (client optional)
      Related Issues: #2932, #3628


== Details of Previous Behavior ==

The ra_neon (formerly, ra_dav) drives delta editors (svn_delta_editor_t) in
accordance with the constraints of that API [1].

[1] http://subversion.apache.org/docs/api/latest/structsvn__delta__editor__t.html#_details


== Details of New Behavior ==

The ra_serf client-side HTTP/DAV layer (introduced in Subversion 1.4, and
made the only DAV layer in Subversion 1.8) does not respect all the
ordering constraints of the delta editor API: it may open two sibling
directores at the same time, which the delta editor API does not permit.


== Rationale for Change ==

The ra_serf layer operates on sibling directores simultaneously in order to
improve overall speed by using the HTTP protocol more efficiently: for
example, by sending more requests without having to wait for the server's
responses in all cases.  

### other reasons? caching? httpv2?


== Impact on API Users ==

Server-side editor implementors cannot both depend upon being driven in
the documented directory-depth-first order and support ra_serf clients.
Server-side editors that will only be accessed over ra_neon/ra_svn/ra_local,
or that do not depend upon the depth-first restriction, are not affected.

Editors shipped with Subversion itself are not affected.

It is expected that this issue will be revisited as part of the "Editor v2"
effort (see issue #3628).
