API ERRATA -- $Id$

Root Cause of Errata: inconsistency
 Library(s) Affected: libsvn_wc
Function(s) Affected: svn_wc_status2
     New Behavior in: 1.7
      Related Issues: n/a


== Details of Previous Behavior ==

Calling svn_wc_status2() on a switched subdirectory could have varying
results, depending on the context the call was made in.  If previous
libsvn_wc calls have populated the associated set of the adm_access
baton, a switched subdirectory would be reported as switched, even if
it was the target of the status call.  If called with a clean cache,
the subdirectory would not be reported as switched.

Additionally, a switched subdirectory is always reported as switched
when the target is the parent, but follows the inconsistent behavior when
the target is the switched subdirectory.


== Details of New Behavior ==

The switched subdirectory is always reported as switched, even if it
is the target of the call to svn_wc_status2().


== Rationale for Change ==

The previous behavior reports different results, depending upon the
internal state of the adm_access baton cache, and the working directory
of the call.  These inconsistencies are undesirable.


== Impact on API Users ==

Only API users who routinely call svn_wc_status2() directly on a switched
subdirectory will be affected.
