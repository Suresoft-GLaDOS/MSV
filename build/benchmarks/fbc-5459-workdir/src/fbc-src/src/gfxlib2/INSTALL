GNU autotools (Autoconf, Automake and co) are needed to build this library.

If the "configure" script is not present, generate it:
	$ autoreconf

If a directory for the target platform is not present, then create it:
	$ mkdir obj/[target-platform]

If the "Makefile" file is not included, generate it:
	$ cd obj/[target-platform]
	$ ../../configure

After that, build and install the library:
	$ cd obj/[target-platform]
	$ make
	$ make install
