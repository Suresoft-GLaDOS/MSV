To compile FB/DOS, ICU4C v3.4 is required. To make it compilable on
DJGPP, you should make the following steps:

1. Unpack ICU4C 3.4

   You can get it from http://icu.sourceforge.net/

2. Apply DJGPP patch (support-djgpp.patch)

   This patch adds support for DJGPP to ICU4C v3.4.

3. ./runConfigureICU DJGPP --prefix=X:/Path/to/DJGPP

   The "--prefix" argument is required because installing via
   /dev/env/DJDIR doesn't work.

4. make

   This command builds ICU4C

5. make check

   Install ICU4C for DJGPP only when "make check" run without errors!

6. Delete/rename DJGPP's ln.exe because it's unusable and avoids 
   installation of ICU4C

   The installation requires "ln -s" to work correctly but DJGPP's
   ln.exe simply fails.

7. Add the new "ln" script to the DJGPP folder (file "ln" in this
   folder)
   
   This script only works for "ln -s" instructions. Please provide
   a better script if you're an experienced script developer.
   
8. make install

   This installs all required header files and libraries to the
   DJGPP folder (see --prefix argument)
