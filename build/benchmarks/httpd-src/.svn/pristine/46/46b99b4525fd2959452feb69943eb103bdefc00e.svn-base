<summary>
    <p>This module provides support for systemd integration. It allows
    starting httpd as a service with systemd <code>Type=notify</code>
    (see systemd.service(5) manual page for more information). It also
    provides statistics in <code>systemctl status</code> output and adds
    various directives useful for systemd integration.

<description>Enable shutting down the httpd when it is idle for some time.</description>
<syntax>IdleShutdown seconds</syntax>
<default>IdleShutdown 0</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>IdleShutdown</directive> directive enables shutting
    down the httpd when it is idle for some time. The idleness is based on
    bytes served, so if there are no bytes sent for some time defined by this
    directive, httpd will shutdown. By default, IdleShutdown is set to 0
    meaning this feature is disabled.
    </p>

    <p>This feature is useful in a combination with systemd socket activation
    (see systemd.socket(5) manual page). When httpd is started by systemd on
    some request, using this directive you can stop the httpd automatically
    when all the requests are served.
    </p>

    <note type="warning"><title>Implementation warning</title><p>
    Because of implementation details, idleness is checked only every 10
    seconds. That means that if you specify <code>IdleShutdown 14</code>,
    httpd will stop itself after 20 seconds of idleness.
