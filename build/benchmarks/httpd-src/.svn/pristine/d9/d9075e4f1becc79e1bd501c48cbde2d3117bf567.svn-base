* Requirements:
** lua 5.1, 5.2 ( http://www.lua.org/ ) or LuaJIT 2.x ( http://www.luajit.org/ )
** Apache HTTPD 2.3 ( http://httpd.apache.org/ ) or higher

* Documentation
  See docs/README

* Building
  For now, see docs/building-from-subversion.txt

* To Consider
  Allow definition of lua_State instances associated with arbitrary
  pool using the pool's user_data constuct. There would, here, be two
  types, pooled and singleton. On the other hand, singleton would work
  fine for almost all cases -- the exception being a process or server
  pool, and then we could stay singleton anyway and lock around it.
  

* Task List
** TODO Use r->file to determine file, doing rewriting in translate_name   
** TODO Provide means to get useful output from lua errors in response body
   Probably have to put it on the vm spec for pre-handler errors, as
   it is pre-handler, will prolly be on the request_config somewhere,
   but sometimes cannot put there, so... fun
** TODO Mapping in the server_rec
** TODO Figure out how reentrancy works regarding filter chain stuff. 
   Do we need new "threads"?
** TODO: Flatten LuaHook* to LuaHook phase file fn ?
** TODO: document or remove block sections
** TODO: test per-dir behavior of block sections
** TODO: Suppress internal details (fs path to scripts, etc) in error responses
