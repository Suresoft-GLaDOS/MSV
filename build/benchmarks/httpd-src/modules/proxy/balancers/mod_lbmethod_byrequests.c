/*
 * The idea behind the find_best_byrequests scheduler is the following:
 *
 * lbfactor is "how much we expect this worker to work", or "the worker's
 * normalized work quota".
 *
 * lbstatus is "how urgent this worker has to work to fulfill its quota
 * of work".
 *
 * We distribute each worker's work quota to the worker, and then look
 * which of them needs to work most urgently (biggest lbstatus).  This
 * worker is then selected for work, and its lbstatus reduced by the
 * total work quota we distributed to all workers.  Thus the sum of all
 * lbstatus does not change.(*)
 *
 * If some workers are disabled, the others will
 * still be scheduled correctly.
 *
 * If a balancer is configured as follows:
 *
 * worker     a    b    c    d
 * lbfactor  25   25   25   25
 *
 * And b gets disabled, the following schedule is produced:
 *
 *    a c d a c d a c d ...
 *
 * Note that the above lbfactor setting is the *exact* same as:
 *
 * worker     a    b    c    d
 * lbfactor   1    1    1    1
 *
 * Asymmetric configurations work as one would expect. For
 * example:
 *
 * worker     a    b    c    d
 * lbfactor   1    1    1    2
 *
 * would have a, b and c all handling about the same
 * amount of load with d handling twice what a or b
 * or c handles individually. So we could see:
 *
 *   b a d c d a c d b d ...
