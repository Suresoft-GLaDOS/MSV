<summary>
<p>This module makes it easy to restrict what HTTP methods can be
used on a server. The most common configuration would be:</p>

<highlight language="config">
&lt;Location "/"&gt;
   AllowMethods GET POST OPTIONS
&lt;/Location&gt;

&lt;Location "/nopost"&gt;
   AllowMethods -POST
&lt;/Location&gt;
</highlight>

<name>AllowMethods</name>
<description>Restrict access to the listed HTTP methods</description>
<syntax>AllowMethods reset | [+|-]<var>HTTP-method</var>
[ [+|-]<var>HTTP-method</var> ] ...</syntax>
<default>AllowMethods reset</default>
<contextlist><context>directory</context></contextlist>
<status>Experimental</status>
<compatibility>+/- added in 2.5.1</compatibility>

<usage>

<p>The HTTP-methods are case sensitive and are generally, as per
RFC, given in upper case. The GET and HEAD methods are treated as
equivalent. The <code>reset</code> keyword can be used to
turn off <module>mod_allowmethods</module> in a deeper nested context:</p>

<highlight language="config">
&lt;Location "/svn"&gt;
   AllowMethods reset
&lt;/Location&gt;
</highlight>

<note><title>Caution</title>
  <p>The TRACE method cannot be denied by this module;
  use <directive module="core">TraceEnable</directive> instead.</p>
</note>

<p>Normally, if multiple <directive>AllowMethods</directive> could
apply to a directory, then the most specific one is used and
others are ignored; the methods are not merged. (See <a
href="../sections.html#merging">how sections are merged</a>.)
However if <em>all</em> the methods on the
<directive>AllowMethods</directive> directive are preceded by a
<code>+</code> or <code>-</code> symbol, the options are
merged. Any method preceded by a <code>+</code> are added to the
methods currently in force, and any method preceded by a
<code>-</code> are removed from the methods currently in
force. </p>

<note><title>Note</title>
<p>Mixing <directive>AllowMethods</directive> with a <code>+</code> or
<code>-</code> with those without is not valid syntax and will be
rejected during server startup by the syntax check with an abort.</p>
</note>

<p><module>mod_allowmethods</module> was written to replace the rather
kludgy implementation of <directive module="core">Limit</directive> and
<directive module="core">LimitExcept</directive>.</p>
