TODO for locking
================


NICE TO HAVE
------------

* support cancellation during lock/unlock.

* "svn rm file" should error if file has "svn:needs-lock" and is not
  locked (is read-only) in WC. On Linux, at least, neither Svn nor the OS
  prevents "svn rm file" from completing. Same for "svn mv" of course.


-----------------------------------------------

* Questions:

   * Should propedit and propset reject to set a property on a file with
     svn:needs-lock set?

   * how do locks relate to dump/load?  file as an enhancement? 


* Stuff to document in book:

       - new 'svn up' and 'svn commit' behaviors w.r.t. locktokens
       - two new bdb tables in BDB section.
       - update the description of autoversioning in appendix C!

* Unfriendly error messages are quoted in the svn-book for trying to commit
  or unlock a file without the correct lock,
  e.g. "Server sent ... 423 Locked ...". Is the book out of date? With 1.6.x,
  RA-local, lock held by me but in a different WC, messages include:
    $ svn ci
    svn: Cannot verify lock on path '/d/2'; no matching lock-token available
    $ svn unlock d/2
    svn: '2' is not locked in this working copy
