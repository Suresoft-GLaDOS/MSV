API ERRATA -- $Id$

Root Cause of Errata: implementation/docstring mismatch
 Library(s) Affected: libsvn_ra_local, libsvn_client
Function(s) Affected: svn_ra_get_dir2, svn_client_list4, svn_client_info4
     New Behavior in: 1.10
      Related Issues: n/a


== Details ==

The docstring for svn_dirent_t.size stated that the value would be 0
for directories. However, the ra_svn and ra_serf layers would use -1
(SVN_INVALID_FILESIZE). This is also the default value set by
svn_dirent_create. Ra_local was the only implementation that complied
to the original docstring.

For the 1.10 release, the docstring has been updated to match the
majority implementation: set svn_dirent_t.size to SVN_INVALID_FILESIZE
for directories. The ra_local code has been updated to comply to the
new docstring.


== Impact on API Users ==

Because the size of directories does not carry meaningful information
and was set differently by different RA implementations, the range of
affected users will be limited.

API users that only tested against the file:// protocol should review
their use of the svn_dirent_t.size for non-file nodes (.kind element).
