API ERRATA -- $Id$

Root Cause of Errata: design error
 Library(s) Affected: svnserve.conf
Function(s) Affected: the 'use-sasl' configuration knob
     New Behavior in: 1.10

== Details ==

The documentation of the '[sasl]' section and the 'use-sasl' option in
svnserve.conf promised that that section would be ignored by Subversion builds
compiled without SASL support.

That behaviour violated the principle of least surprise and could lead to
incorrect authentication and authorization settings being used, if an svnserve
compiled without SASL support was inadvertently used with an svnserve.conf
file specifying 'use-sasl = true'.

svnserve has been changed to decline to serve a repository, if svnserve.conf
contains the setting 'use-sasl = true' and SASL support was not compiled in.


== Impact on API Users ==

Subversion builds compiled with SASL support will have no change in behaviour.

Subversion builds compiled without SASL support will now decline to serve
repositories when the svnserve.conf config file sets 'use-sasl = true' in the
'[sasl]' section.  Such repositories may set 'use-sasl = false' to restore the
effective 1.9 behaviour, or recompile svnserve with SASL support to use SASL
transport.

If 'use-sasl' is not explicitly set (commented out), it defaults to 'false'.
Installations using this setting are unaffected, regardless of svnserve compile
options.

The default location of svnserve.conf is REPOS_DIR/conf/svnserve.conf on the
server (the file is not versioned), but this may be changed via the
'--config-file' command-line option.
