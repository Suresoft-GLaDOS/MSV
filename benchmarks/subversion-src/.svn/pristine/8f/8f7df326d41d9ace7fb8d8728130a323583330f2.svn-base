This tracked the remaining TODOs for the 'Test Review' roadmap item for
1.7's release status (http://subversion.apache.org/roadmap), i.e.:

  "Determine which XFail and WIP tests should remain so,
   and which need to be fixed before release."

To answer that question (for 1.7 or any future release) we can now simply run:

(Windows)
  win-tests.py --list --mode-filter xfail --log-to-stdout
  --milestone-filter="1.7.0"

(Unix-like)
   make check MILESTONE_FILTER="1.7.0" MODE_FILTER=xfail \
    TESTS=subversion/tests/cmdline/*py
