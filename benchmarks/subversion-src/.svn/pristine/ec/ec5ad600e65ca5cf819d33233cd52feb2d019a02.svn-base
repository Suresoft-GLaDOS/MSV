.SH DESCRIPTION
Executes
.B svnserve
in tunnel mode with the tunnel user set to
.I tunnel_user
and the virtual repository root path set to
.IR svn_root .

Specifically, the executable named by
.I svnserve_path
is executed (see
.BR exec (3))
with the environment set to
.I envp
and with arguments
.BI \-\-root= svn_root\c
,
.B \-\-tunnel\c
, and
.BI \-\-tunnel\-user= tunnel_user
appended to the arguments given in
.IR argv .

This is thread-safe if the user's C POSIX library is thread-safe.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I svnserve_path
Null-terminated string containing the path to the
.B svnserve
executable.  This must be an absolute path and must refer to an
existing executable file.  This parameter must not be the null
pointer.  Callers are encouraged to use
.BR svnstsw_fso_is_changeable (3)
to check the safety of using the path before calling this function.
.TP
.I svn_root
Null-terminated string containing the repository virtual root path,
passed to
.B svnserve
via its
.B \-\-root
command-line parameter.  If this parameter is the null pointer or an
empty string, the root directory
.RB (' / ')
is used.  The path must be an absolute path, must exist, and must
refer to a directory.  Callers are encouraged to use
.BR svnstsw_fso_is_changeable (3)
to check the safety of using the path before calling this function.
.TP
.I tunnel_user
Null-terminated string containing the Subversion username, passed to
.B svnserve
via its
.B --tunnel-user
command-line parameter.  This parameter must not be the null pointer
or an empty string.  Callers are encouraged to use the string returned
by
.BR svnstsw_get_tunnel_user_name (3)
for this parameter.
.TP
.I argv
Null-terminated array of null-terminated strings to use as the first
arguments to the
.B svnserve
executable.  Note that convention dictates that
.IR argv [0]
must match
.IR svnserve_path .
If this parameter is the null pointer, it is the equivalent to passing
in a two-element array consisting of
.I svnserve_path
and a null terminator.  The
.BI \-\-root= svn_root\c
\&,
.B \-\-tunnel\c
, and
.BI \-\-tunnel\-user= user
arguments will be appended to the arguments in
.I argv
before being passed to the executable named by
.IR svnserve_path .
.TP
.I envp
Null-terminated array of null-terminated strings containing the
desired environment for the
.B svnserve
process.  If this parameter is the null pointer, it is the equivalent
to passing in an array consisting of only a null terminator.  By
convention, each string in this array should be in the form of
.IR name = value .
For security reasons, the contents of
.I envp
might not be passed as-is to the executable named by
.IR svnserve_path .
.SH RETURN VALUE
Does not return on success.

On failure, returns a negative value and sets
.I errno
(see
.BR errno (3)).
.SH ERRORS
Error conditions and
.I errno
(see
.BR errno (3))
values are described in the specifications for
.BR stat "(3), " snprintf "(3), and " execve (3),
with the addition that
.B EINVAL
may indicate an invalid parameter.
.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Executables using this function are expected to be installed with
either the setuid or the setgid bit set.  Because of this, there are a
few recommendations:
.RS 1
.IP \- 3
The executable named by the
.I svnserve_path
argument should not be a shell script because of numerous well-known
attacks via specially-crafted environment variables and arguments.
.IP \- 3
The
.I envp
argument should be empty (either the null pointer or an array
containing only a null terminator).  This is especially true if the
executable named by the
.I svnserve_path
argument is a shell script.
.IP \- 3
.I svnserve_path
and
.I svn_root
should be passed through
.BR svnstsw_fso_is_changeable (3)
to make sure that neither they nor their parent directories are
writable by the user.
